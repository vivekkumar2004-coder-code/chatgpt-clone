gemini-embedding-001

pinecone db is used as a db 

sentence ->  tokenization -> importants from sentence -> embedding -> gemini-2.0-flash -> output

1. create a pinecone service 
2. from docs get api key and start it by integrating api 
3. create an index or  identifyy if made on pinecone db automatically `
4. create a function of create memory where it will take input as a object of vector and metadata

5. create a query function wwhich will search the database with parameters queryvector limit and metadata

6. require the functions in socket 

7. we will use embeddings from gemini memory creation for VEctor database and will be done in ai.service return response.embeddings[0].values

 
8 now saving the response from ai in socketserver  and saved in pine cone db 

9. we have to wquery the memory  and find the relatable stuffs for the new query
